# Web XR Physics
The WebXR API is a brand new spec that gives developers the ability to create VR and AR experiences that run natively in the browser. Our physics demo uses this API to create an immersive experience that students can use to learn physics fundamentals.

This is an OSU Senior Capstone project for group 47. The goal is to demonstrate the abilities of the WebXR API by creating a sample project that can be referenced by others later. The project is sponsored by Intel. 

## Getting set up
After cloning the project, open up the root project repo and install the dependencies using
```
$ npm i
```

Start the development server using 
```
$ npm run dev
```
The project will be running on `http://localhost:1234`. The development server will watch for changes in the source files and automatically reload the page after compiling them.
