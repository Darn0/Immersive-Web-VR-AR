       	\noindent 
       	    Web virtual reality and augmented reality are technologies that are just getting started and are very cutting edge. In the past few years, a standard has come out specifying an API for creating web apps that use virtual reality and augmented reality. Because this is such a new field, there are not many projects that provide examples to other developers trying to use this technology. The goal of our project is to create an app that provides a showcase of the things web VR and AR can do and a reference for these developers. As of now, there is no specification on the actual VR/AR app we will be creating; that will be defined as we research the technology. We will also need to document research we have done and problems we encounter so that others can use it as a reference for building web AR/VR apps.
