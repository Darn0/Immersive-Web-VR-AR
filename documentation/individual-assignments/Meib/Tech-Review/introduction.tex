\section{Introduction}
We want virtual reality to be easier for developers can make something quickly and able to share it with everyone, without compatible issue or what device they're on. My focus of this research will be for the various web hosting technology and access immersive version of the website. Web hosting is a service that allows individuals or organization to host a website or web page onto the internet for the community to see. This project will be demoing in a host website and will later ultimately be deployed in the OpenSource portal of Intel O1.org. The main goal is to promote VR and AR technologies through the web browsers and help display the immersive web. However, there are plenty of services to deploy and host a site like AWS, GitHub, or self-hosting. With the foundation of WebXR of enhanced VR web experience, we need to pick and choose a web hosting that works best for this immersive VR web experience.
