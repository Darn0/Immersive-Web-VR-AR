\textbf{Section} & \textbf{Original} & \textbf{New} \\

%----------
1.3.3
&
\begin{itemize}
    \item WebXR API
    \item WebGL 2.0
    \item (Some physics API)
    \item If needed:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Web Workers
        \item Web Assembly (for physics / processing intensive code or porting non-JavaScript libraries)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
& 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Add mention of Cannon.js, Three.js
    \item Remove use of web workers and web assembly
\end{itemize} \\
\hline

%----------
1.4
&
\begin{itemize}
    \item XR : Family of hardware devices capable of Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality.
    \item API : Application Program Interface.
    \item HMD : Head mounted display. There is an optic lens for each eye which runs at 90Hz.
    \item WebXR : Open source web API for accessing virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) devices, including sensors and head-mounted displays.
    \item WebGL : Open graphics API.
    \item Web Worker : API for performing and communicating between parallel computation on the Web.
\end{itemize}
&
\begin{itemize}
    \item Remove reference to web workers, since we did not use them.
\end{itemize} \\
\hline

%----------
2.1
&
\begin{itemize}
    \item Users will be able to interact with objects in the environment through their controller (or simulated/virtual controller)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Translate objects
        \item Scale objects
        \item Rotate objects
        \item Pick up/grasp objects
        \item Drop/throw objects
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
& 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Removed the requirement to scale objects.
    \item Giving users the ability to scale objects worked against a good user experience as scaling could go wrong in many ways.
    \item User-scaled objects often got in the way of UI elements and in some cases removed the ability to scale objects down entirely.
    \item Without a second button on the daydream controller, scaling had to be done using in scene UI elements.
\end{itemize} \\
\hline

%----------
2.1
&
\begin{itemize}
    \item User can "pause/play". 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item During pause mode, objects are not animated and are not affected by the physics engine.
        \item During play mode, objects are animated and are affected by physics.
    \end{itemize}
    \item User can "freeze" objects, stopping all kinematic forces that the object is experiencing
\end{itemize}
& 
\begin{itemize}
    \item As with the scaling issue above, we were severely limited by the single button functionality that the controllers could provide.
    \item Without a dedicated GUI for this sort of project, we decided that it was more important to place our focus on polishing the VR components rather than struggling with out-of-scope additions.
\end{itemize} \\
\hline

2.5
&
\begin{itemize}
    \item Website will be compatible with (Enter list of devices here)
\end{itemize}
&
\begin{itemize}
    \item Added a list of compatible devices.
\end{itemize} \\
\hline

2.5
&
\begin{itemize}
    \item Website will run on multiple devices and operating systems (Windows, Android, Mac)
\end{itemize}
&
\begin{itemize}
    \item WebXR is not compatible with iOS devices.
\end{itemize} \\
